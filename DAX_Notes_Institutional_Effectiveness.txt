# DAX Notes â€“ Institutional Effectiveness Project

These are the key DAX formulas used in the Power BI dashboard for calculating graduation status:

---

-- Graduation Status within 4 Years
Graduated_4yr = IF([Graduation Term] <= "201630", "Graduated", "Not Graduated")

-- Graduation Status within 6 Years
Graduated_6yr = IF([Graduation Term] <= "201830", "Graduated", "Not Graduated")

-- Graduation Status within 8 Years
Graduated_8yr = IF([Graduation Term] <= "202030", "Graduated", "Not Graduated")

---

# Additional Tips:
- The Graduation Term is assumed to be in text format. If it's in numeric format, you can use numbers directly (e.g., 201630).
- These calculated columns were used in bar charts and KPI cards to visually compare graduation rates.
- Use slicers for Ethnicity and Cohort Type to create dynamic breakdowns.

# Visualizations Powered by DAX:
- Stacked Column Chart (Graduated vs Not Graduated by Ethnicity)
- KPI Cards (Overall 4, 6, 8-Year Grad Rates)
- Slicers for Cohort Year and Type
